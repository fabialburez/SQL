#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);
#or
SELECT DISTINCT product, MIN(price) as price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT DISTINCT product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product;

6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT DISTINCT product, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum), ROUND(AVG(quantity*price),2) AS avg_spent
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customers
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
